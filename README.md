- Python (Flask)
- MySQL (Database)
- SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Flask RESTful APIs
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8+** - [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Flask** - [Flask Installation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/installation/)
3. **MySQL** - [Install MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash

cd Merit-backend-NG_version
```


### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the necessary dependencies for the project.

#### Key Packages:

- `Flask`: Web framework
- `SQLAlchemy`: ORM for database interaction
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy`: Extension for using SQLAlchemy with Flask
- `PyMySQL`: MySQL database connector

### Step 3: Running the Project

start the Flask development server:

```bash
# Export environment variables and run Flask
export FLASK_APP=views.py
flask run
```

This will start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
